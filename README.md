## Cards Against Humanity



Cards Against Humanity: `fill in the blank` Edition is a fill-in-the-blank party game. Each
round, one player asks the group a question from a black card. These cards consist of inside jokes, memories, and more.

One random player begins as the `Czar` and draws a black card.

The Czar reads the black card out loud. Everyone else then answers the
question (or fills in the blank) by passing one white card, face down, to the Czar.

The Czar then shuffles all the white cards and re-reads the black card out loud
with each one. Finally, the Czar picks the funniest combination, and whoever
played it gets one point/the black card.
