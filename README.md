<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2 id="about-the-project"> :pencil: About The Project</h2>

<p align="justify"> 

Cards Against Humanity: `fill in the blank` Edition is a fill-in-the-blank party game. Each
round, one player asks the group a question from a black card. These cards consist of inside jokes, memories, and more.

One random player begins as the `Czar` and draws a black card.

The Czar reads the black card out loud. Everyone else then answers the
question (or fills in the blank) by passing one white card, face down, to the Czar.

The Czar then shuffles all the white cards and re-reads the black card out loud
with each one. Finally, the Czar picks the funniest combination, and whoever
played it gets one point/the black card.

<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<h2 id="overview"> :cloud: Overview</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
Cards Against Humanity: Fill in the Blank Edition takes the outrageous and irreverent gameplay of the original party game to new levels of hilarity. Designed to bring friends, families, and acquaintances closer through laughter, this game provides a perfect platform for creating inside jokes, recalling funny memories, and engaging in twisted humor.

### Gameplay:
The game starts with one player being randomly selected as the Czar for the round. The Czar draws a black card, which contains a question or a statement with one or more blanks. The black cards often touch on taboo subjects, current events, or the darkest corners of our collective humor.

The Czar reads the black card aloud, and the other players must select a white card from their hand to fill in the blank(s) or provide a humorous response. The white cards contain various phrases, words, or combinations that can be absurd, witty, or downright outrageous.

Once everyone has chosen a white card, they pass it face-down to the Czar. The Czar then shuffles all the white cards to maintain anonymity and proceeds to read the black card out loud again, replacing the blank(s) with the responses provided by the players.

At this point, the Czar becomes the ultimate judge of comedic value and reads each combination aloud. The goal is to select the funniest or most clever response from the mix of white cards. The player who played the chosen white card earns a point, representing their victory for that round.

### Unleash Your Dark Humor:
Cards Against Humanity: Fill in the Blank Edition encourages players to let loose and embrace their darkest sense of humor. The game thrives on the unexpected, pushing boundaries, and exploring the unspoken. It allows players to express their creativity and wit by providing unique answers to the prompts, often leading to hilarious or cringe-worthy results.

### Inside Jokes and Memories:
As players continue to engage with the game over time, they develop a shared set of inside jokes and memories. The game becomes a catalyst for creating new hilarious moments and referencing past experiences, making it an excellent choice for gatherings with close friends or long-standing groups.
